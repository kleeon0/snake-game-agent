# Snake Game Using A Genetic Algorithm

## About

This is a simple implementation of the classic Snake game using a genetic algorithm to evolve the snake's behavior. The game and the genetic algorithm are both built using p5js.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser that supports p5js (like Chrome or Firefox).
3. The game will start automatically, and you can watch the snake evolve over generations.

## Features

- The snake learns to navigate the game environment by evolving its behavior through generations.
- The genetic algorithm selects the fittest snakes based on their performance in the game.
- The game is rendered using p5js.

## Requirements

- A modern web browser with JavaScript support.
- p5js library (included in the project).
